Brick Breaker with Block Collision
Overview
This project is a classic "Brick Breaker" game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball upward, aiming to break blocks arranged in rows. As the player progresses, the ball's speed increases every few blocks hit, making the game more challenging. The game ends either when the ball falls past the paddle or when all blocks are destroyed, resulting in a win.

Features
Ball and Paddle Movement: Smooth ball and paddle controls.
Collision Detection: Ball detects and responds to collisions with walls, the paddle, and blocks.
Dynamic Speed Increase: The ball speed increases incrementally for every few blocks destroyed.
Scoring and Win Condition: Tracks score based on blocks destroyed. Displays "You Win!" if all blocks are cleared.
Game Over and Restart: Displays "Game Over" if the ball falls past the paddle, with an option to restart by pressing "R".
Controls
Left Arrow: Move paddle left.
Right Arrow: Move paddle right.
R Key: Restart the game after game over or win.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
Pygame: Install Pygame by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Running the Game
Save the code in a file named brick_breaker.py.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python brick_breaker.py
A window should open, and you can begin playing immediately by using the arrow keys.
Code Breakdown
Constants and Variables
Screen Dimensions: Width and height of the game screen are set with WIDTH, HEIGHT.
Colors: Defined using RGB values for easy customization.
Ball and Paddle: Ball radius, starting position, and initial speed; paddle dimensions and speed are customizable.
Block Properties: Blocks are arranged in rows and columns, each with specific dimensions and padding.
Functions
create_blocks(): Initializes the blocks in rows and columns.
reset_game(): Resets game elements to initial values for replayability.
Main Game Loop
Event Handling: Exits the game when the window is closed.
Key Handling: Checks if the left or right arrow key is pressed to move the paddle.
Collision Detection:
Wall Collision: Ball bounces off screen edges.
Paddle Collision: Ball reverses direction upon hitting the paddle.
Block Collision: Ball bounces upon hitting a block, which then disappears, incrementing the score and potentially increasing ball speed.
Game Over Condition: If the ball passes the paddle, the game ends, displaying a "Game Over" message.
Winning Condition: If all blocks are cleared, displays a win message.
Display and Rendering
Text Display: Score and end-game messages are rendered at specific screen positions.
Paddle and Ball Drawing: Paddle is rendered as a rectangle; the ball is a filled circle.
Screen Refresh: Updates at 60 FPS for smooth animation.
Customization
You can tweak various constants, such as:

Ball speed: Adjust ball_speed or ball_speed_increment.
Block layout: Modify BLOCK_ROWS, BLOCK_COLS, BLOCK_WIDTH, and BLOCK_HEIGHT for different configurations.
Paddle speed: Change paddle_speed for a faster or slower paddle.
Requirements
Pygame library is required to run this game. You can install it by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
