# Brick Breaker with Block Collision

## Overview
This project is a classic "Brick Breaker" game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball upward, aiming to break blocks arranged in rows. As the player progresses, the ball's speed increases every few blocks hit, making the game more challenging. The game ends either when the ball falls past the paddle or when all blocks are destroyed, resulting in a win.

## Features
- **Ball and Paddle Movement**: Smooth ball and paddle controls.
- **Collision Detection**: Ball detects and responds to collisions with walls, the paddle, and blocks.
- **Dynamic Speed Increase**: The ball speed increases incrementally for every few blocks destroyed.
- **Scoring and Win Condition**: Tracks score based on blocks destroyed. Displays "You Win!" if all blocks are cleared.
- **Game Over and Restart**: Displays "Game Over" if the ball falls past the paddle, with an option to restart by pressing "R".

## Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move paddle left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move paddle right.
- **R Key**: Restart the game after game over or win.
